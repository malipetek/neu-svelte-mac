# Neutralino Svelte MacOS App Boilerplate

## Get started
You can get started with this project with following command.

`npx degit malipetek/neu-svelte-mac`

Then run 

`npm i -s`

Then start developing with 

`npm run dev`

After you have done some stuff build your app with

`npm run build`

This is where this boilerplate shines, it will generate an app file instead of a binary. 

If you encounter issues, well, open issues.
